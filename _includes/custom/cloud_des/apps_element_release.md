To release your app, you need to associate your app to a plan, and then publish the app, which changes its status to `Active`. Once the app is associated with a plan and published, sites will start to get the app installed automatically, as follows:
* **Existing sites**: Sites associated with the app's plan have the app automatically installed as soon as the app is set to `Active`.
* â€‹**Newly created site**: If the new site chooses the plan associated with the app, the app is pre-installed to the site.
* **Site is upgraded**: If an existing site is upgraded to the app's plan, the app is installed during the upgrade.
* **Site plan changes**: If an existing site changes to a plan not associated with the app, the app is automatically uninstalled from the site. However, any instances of the app on the site will remain.


**To release your app**:
1. Associate your app with a plan. On the {%if site.project=="designer"%}[app's detail](ds_gs_admin.html#apps){%elsif site.project=="cloud"%}[app's detail](cl_gs_admin.html#apps){%endif%} page, click **Auto-Install Settings**. A dialog displays the plans that you've created.
2. Select the plans that should include this app and click **Save**.

3. From the Version History area of the App Details page, click the ellipsis button for the version to become active, and choose **Publish Version**. The status for this version moves from `Draft` to `Active`
    {% include note.html content="Only one version of an app can be active at a given time. When you publish your app, if there was a previous active version, that one is moved to `Archived`." %}
