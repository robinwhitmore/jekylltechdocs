Team members must have a unique email as an identifier (and is the username for logging into the Cloud Admin), and are assigned a role that determines what they can access in the portal.

## Team Member Roles
When you create a team member, you must associate them with a role. Roles determine what they can and cannot do in Cloud Admin.

Here are the roles and their permissions:
* **Admin**: Can access all portal functionality. Can view, create, edit, and delete {{site.customer}} and team members. Can view, create, edit, log into, and publish all websites. Can access account settings and billing information.
