When a user creates a new site, they are taken to the Theme gallery where they view screenshots of each available theme. They also visit the gallery if they decide to change the theme for their site.

{% include image.html file="themeGallery.png" caption="The Theme Gallery in Weebly" %}

You need to create a screenshot to display your theme in this gallery. To best show off its potential, take a screenshot showing the theme as it displays when applied to the home page of a site.

The screenshot needs to meet these requirements:
* Saved as `screenshot.jpg` to the root of the theme's directory
* Measure `1590px` wide, `894px` wide, with a DPI of `480`
