â€‹Your manifest requires additional entries if you are creating an {% if site.project=="designer" %}[element](ds_apps_element_create.html){%elsif site.project=="cloud" %}[element](cl_apps_element_create.html){%elsif site.project=="platform" %}[element](pf_apps_element_create.html){%endif%}.

Here's a manifest showing all elements for a backend service or snippet - an element or dashboard card will require more.
