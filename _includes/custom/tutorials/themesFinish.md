You customized our Base theme to create your own theme! If you were developing a theme for use on many sites, you'd probably now want to create a bunch of different test sites with different types of pages and apply your new theme to make sure they look great everywhere.

In this tutorial, you learned how to add a color palette to a theme, create light and dark variations, edit the layout of a theme, edit the CSS the determines how a theme displays, edit a partial, and create theme options! You then zipped up your theme and made it available to anyone that wants to use it.

â€‹Go ahead and use your new theme as a starting point for developing a completely designed theme.
