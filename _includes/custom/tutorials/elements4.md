We’ll be zipping up our development directory to deliver the app, so we need to create a directory structure that’s valid for Weebly.
1. Create a directory named `PriceChart`. This is the root level directory.
2. As a child to that directory, create a sub-directory and name it `files`.
   ​The root directory may contain one or more elements as part of the total app. Since our app is a single element, we’ll create just this one sub-directory.
3. Within the files directory, create the following sub-directories:
   * `css`
   * `html`
   * `js`
   * `assets`
4. From the sample app directory that you unzipped (from the prerequisites step), copy the `icon.svg` file to the `PriceChart/files` directory. We won’t be creating this icon in the tutorial, and you’ll need it in order to upload your app.
