In this tutorial, you'll learn how to customize a Weebly theme. Instead of starting from scratch, we'll use the Base theme, which provides all the Weebly-specific building blocks needed to work on the Weebly platform.

**You'll learn how to:**
* Create the required directory structure
* Add a color palette so that users can choose their own primary and accent colors for the theme
* Edit a header template to alter the way the title and navigation display
* Edit the LESS file to alter styles and other display properties in the theme
* Create light and dark versions of the theme
* Edit a partial to alter how content displays on a page
* Create a theme option that allows the user to change the width of the heading

**Time to complete:** About an hour

**User experience:** Intermediate Web Design with knowledge of LESS/CSS

**Prerequisites:**
* Some knowledge of what makes up a Weebly Theme. Read {%if site.project=="designer"%}[Anatomy of a Theme](ds_themes_anatomy.html){%elsif site.project=="cloud"%}[Anatomy of a Theme](cl_themes_anatomy.html){%elsif site.project=="platform"%}[Anatomy of a Theme](pf_themes_anatomy.html){%endif%}
 before starting this tutorial.
* The Weebly Code Editor accessed from the Theme tab of the Weebly Editor.
* An app that can take a screenshot and then edit it to the required size.
