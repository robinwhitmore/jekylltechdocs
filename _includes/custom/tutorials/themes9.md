Now that we're done customizing the theme, let's take a screenshot so that it can display in the Weebly Theme Gallery, shown when a user creates a site.

1. {% include custom/notes/code_editor.md %}

2. In the Code Editor, take a screenshot of the theme from the preview below the code. If your screenshot app allows it, try to make the size of the screenshot 1590px wide, 894px high, with a DPI of 480, and saved as a JPG. Or you can edit the shot after taking it to meet these requirements.

    {%include tip.html content="Normally, you'd take the screenshot from a published site, but for this tutorial, we'll just use the editor preview." %}

2. Save the screenshot to a local directory with the name `screenshot.jpg`.

â€‹The screenshot needs to be part of the zip file that you'll upload to Weebly. We'll do that in the next step.
