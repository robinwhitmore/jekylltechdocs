While templates (like the Header template we just customized) determine the layout of a page, partials determine the content that displays on the page. For example, blog posts use the blog post partial and it uses mustache tags to pull in content specifically needed to display blog posts. Partials are used throughout a Weebly site, and some pages are made up of a number of different partials. You can read more about partials {%if site.project=="designer"%}[here](ds_themes_partials.html){%elsif site.project=="cloud"%}[here](cl_themes_partials.html){%elsif site.project=="platform"%}[here](pf_themes_partials.html){%endif%}.

Let's edit the blog post partial. Currently, it displays the date below the title.

{% include image.html file="theme_blogDefault.png" caption="Blog post partial by default has the date below the title." %}

Let's switch the date to be above the title.

{% capture post_change_note %}
In order to see your changes, you need to create a blog post. Follow the instructions <a href="https://hc.weebly.com/hc/en-us/articles/201405086-Create-a-Blog-Post">here</a>.
{% endcapture%}

{% include note.html type="tip" content=post_change_note %}


Now, let's edit the partial.

1. If you're in the Code Editor, click **Save** (or **Cancel**) to exit.

2. Click the **Blog** link on the page in the editor. Now the blog post page will display in the code editor so we can see our changes.

3. From the **Theme** tab, click **Edit HTML/CSS**.

4. Under the `Partials` directory, expand the `blog` section and click on `post.tpl` to open it.
â€‹
5. Find the `blog-title` and `blog-date` entries. Copy the `<h2>` tag that contains the `blog-title` and move it below the `<p>` tag with the `blog-date`.
    {% include image.html file="theme_blog_edit.gif" caption="Move the date" %}

6. Click **Save**.

The date and the title are now switched. Now let's add a theme option that allows a user to change the width of the header.

### What Just Happened?

You edited the partial used to display a blog post. By changing the order of the date and title of the post, every blog post that uses this theme will have this change.
