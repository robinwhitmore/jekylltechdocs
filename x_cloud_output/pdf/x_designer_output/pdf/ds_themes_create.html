    <div class="summary">The best way to create a theme is start with an existing theme and change it as you need.</div>
    
    <p>To begin customizing a theme, you can download our <a href="ds_themes_sample.html">Base theme</a> and <a href="ds_themes_import_export.html">import</a> it as a starting point. Or open any theme in the Code Editor and begin editing its files. As you open a theme in the editor, the theme is cloned and Weebly saves it as <code class="highlighter-rouge">MyTheme</code>, so you won’t overwrite the original. When you click <strong>Save</strong>, you can change the name to something more appropriate.</p>

<p>Here’s an overview on how to create a theme. Click on the links for detailed instructions.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Find a theme that you want to start with and open it in the editor (don’t try to create a theme from scratch). Or import our <a href="ds_themes_sample.html">Base theme</a>, and start from there.</p>
  </li>
  <li>If you want to use external tools, <a href="ds_themes_import_export.html">export</a> the theme you want to use as a base.
    <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> <b>Note:</b> <a href="ds_themes_partials.html">Partials</a> are not exported unless they’ve been customized. So if you want to edit any partials, make a small change to them before exporting.</div>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="ds_themes_implement_css.html">Implement the CSS or LESS</a>. The quickest way to start seeing changes in your theme is to start editing or adding styles. You can look at the styles from other themes for ideas and inspiration.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Optionally edit or create the <a href="ds_themes_create_templates.html">HTML template</a> files. You’ll need a template for each header type that you want your theme to use. Add optional header areas or sections.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Edit and/or create <a href="ds_themes_partials.html">partials</a>. You can edit the partials to change parts of a page and you can create your own partials to include in other pages.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Optionally add <a href="ds_themes_variations.html">color variations</a>, <a href="ds_themes_palette.html">color palettes</a>, and <a href="ds_themes_options.html">user options</a> for your theme.
​</li>
  <li>If working externally, zip up the theme, <a href="ds_themes_import_export.html">import</a> it, and test.
​</li>
  <li>Create the theme’s <a href="ds_themes_screenshot.html">screenshot</a>.
​</li>
  <li>Repeat Steps 3-7 until you’re done!</li>
</ol>

<p>​Once you’re done creating and testing your theme, you use the <a data-container="body" data-toggle="popover" data-content="The site used to manage your users, site owners and their accounts, as well as apps and billing. You access Cloud Admin at weeblycloud.com/admin">Cloud Admin</a> to make it available to your customers. See <a href="ds_themes_deliver.html">Deliver Your Theme</a> for details.</p>
