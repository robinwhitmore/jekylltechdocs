    <div class="summary">Welcome to Weebly Cloud for Designers! With Weebly Cloud, you use Weebly’s best-in-class website builder to create websites, blogs or online stores in minutes for your clients, and the Cloud Admin to maintain full control over billing, support, and the customer relationship.</div>
    
    
<h2 id="what-is-weebly-cloud-for-designers">What is Weebly Cloud for Designers?</h2>

<p>Weebly is a best-in-class website builder that allows you to create websites, blogs and online stores for your clients in minutes. You use our <a data-container="body" data-toggle="popover" data-content="The site used to manage your users, site owners and their accounts, as well as apps and billing. You access Cloud Admin at weeblycloud.com/admin">Cloud Admin</a> to manage clients and sites and you can use our RESTful API to create custom apps to further your clients’ sites functionality.</p>

<h2 id="create-a-weebly-cloud-account">Create a Weebly Cloud Account</h2>

<p>Your first step is to get a Weebly Cloud account. This account gives you access to Cloud Admin where you can access your client’s information, along with your API key and secret that gives you access to the the Cloud API. If you don’t have a Weebly Cloud account, then email our team <a href="mailto:bd@weebly.com">here</a>.</p>

<p>Once your account is set up, head on over to <a href="ds_gs_configure.html">Configure Weebly Cloud</a>  to finish setting up your account.</p>

<h2 id="test-mode">Test Mode</h2>

<p>When first getting acquainted with the Weebly Cloud, your account will be in <a data-container="body" data-toggle="popover" data-content="A mode that allows you to create test users and sites without being charged.">test mode</a>. There are no functional limitations while in test mode, it simply defaults any users and sites created to test so that you won’t be charged for them. They will be periodically removed from the system, but only after your Weebly Cloud account is in production mode.</p>

<p>Once in production mode you can still create a test user in the Cloud Admin or by passing the optional parameter of <strong>test_mode</strong>. Learn more about the <a href="ds_api_user.html">User API</a></p>

<h2 id="the-cloud-admin">The Cloud Admin</h2>
<!--Cloud Admin-->

<p>Many of the operations needed to manage your customers’ websites are accomplished using the <a data-container="body" data-toggle="popover" data-content="The site used to manage your users, site owners and their accounts, as well as apps and billing. You access Cloud Admin at weeblycloud.com/admin">Cloud Admin</a>, including the ability to create, manage, and delete sites. You access the portal from <code class="highlighter-rouge">https://your-domain/admin</code>.</p>

<h2 id="add-apps">Add Apps</h2>
<p>You can add more functionality to web sites by visiting the Weebly App Center and downloading and installing apps created by Weebly and by third-party partners. ​You can browse through collections, categories and sub-categories, can filter based on ratings, popularity, freshness, or for free apps, and can search using keywords.</p>

<p>You can control whether or not you want your client to be able to visit the App Center, and if you do, you can make the center available only to sites on certain plans.</p>

<p>Additionally you can create your own apps and have them automatically installed based on the plan a site is associated with. More on the App Center and custom apps <a href="ds_gs_apps.html">here</a> .</p>

<div class="Notice type_info" role="alert">
	<b>Note:</b> The App Center is not white-labeled. That is, the Weebly brand appears throughout the center.
</div>

<h2 id="customize-themes">Customize Themes</h2>

<p>A Weebly theme provides a general structure and design palette for any website built using the Weebly editor. Weebly strives to provide ultimate flexibility for our users, so our themes don’t dictate a template or a mandatory organization of content. Instead, they provide a beautiful backdrop for the site’s content.</p>

<p>While we provide a number of themes, you may want to create your own. Because themes need to have very specific structures and files in order to work on the Weebly platform, instead of creating a custom theme from scratch, you can start with any theme and then customize it to meet your needs. We also provide a base theme that you can use as a start. More about customizing themes <a href="ds_themes_start.html">here</a>, including a tutorial that walks you through the process.</p>

<p>You can customize a theme directly from the Weebly Editor. Click the Theme tab and then click
<strong>Edit HTML/CSS</strong> to open the built-in Code Editor.</p>

<p>​​​You <a href="ds_themes_deliver.html">manage</a> your custom themes from the Theme tab of the Cloud Admin. Any themes you add here are available for you and your client when  editing a site.</p>
