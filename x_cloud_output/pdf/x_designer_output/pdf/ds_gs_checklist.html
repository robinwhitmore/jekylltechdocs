    <div class="summary">Use this checklist to get up and running quickly with Weebly Cloud for Designers</div>
    
    <p>You need a web browser and your login information to access Weebly Cloud. Get your login credentials from your account representative.</p>

<h2 id="1-get-familiar-with-the-cloud-admin-the-user-portal-and-the-weebly-editor">1. Get Familiar with the Cloud Admin, the User Portal, and the Weebly Editor</h2>
<p>These are the tools you, your team members (if you have any), and your clients use to create and manage sites.</p>
<h3 id="cloud-admin">Cloud Admin</h3>
<!--Cloud Admin-->

<p>Many of the operations needed to manage your customers’ websites are accomplished using the <a data-container="body" data-toggle="popover" data-content="The site used to manage your users, site owners and their accounts, as well as apps and billing. You access Cloud Admin at weeblycloud.com/admin">Cloud Admin</a>, including the ability to create, manage, and delete sites. You access the portal from <code class="highlighter-rouge">https://your-domain/admin</code>.</p>

<div class="Notice type_info" role="alert">
	<b>Note:</b> If your domain is a subdomain of <code class="highlighter-rouge">weeblycloud.com</code>, then you can also access the admin from <code class="highlighter-rouge">https://weeblycloud.com/admin</code>.
</div>

<p>Users of the Cloud Admin are called Team Members, and you can configure the access to functionality they have on the <a href="ds_gs_team_members.html">Team Member</a>  page.</p>

<p>Learn about the Cloud Admin <a href="ds_gs_admin.html">here</a> 
.</p>
<h3 id="user-portal">User Portal</h3>
<p>Your clients access sites through the User Portal at <code class="highlighter-rouge">https://your-domain/portal</code>.</p>

<div class="Notice type_info" role="alert">
	<b>Note:</b> If your domain is a subdomain of <code class="highlighter-rouge">weeblycloud.com</code>, then you can also access the portal from <code class="highlighter-rouge">https://weeblycloud.com/portal</code>.
</div>

<p>Here, they can view site stats as well as access the Weebly Editor. You configure the level of access clients have by setting <a href="ds_gs_access_sites.html">site contributor permissions</a>.</p>

<p>More about the User Portal <a href="ds_gs_client_ui.html">here</a> .</p>
<h3 id="weebly-editor">Weebly Editor</h3>
<p>You use the <a data-container="body" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Page where you can edit your site's web pages. Developers use this to test their apps in their test site. Accessed from the Site Home page by clicking Build.">Weebly editor</a> to design websites. It’s as easy as dragging <a data-container="body" data-toggle="popover" data-content="Elements are the widgets users drag from the editor sidebar onto a page to declaratively build their site. An app might contain one or more elements.">elements</a> from the <a data-container="body" data-toggle="popover" data-content="The sidebar of the Page Editor that holds the elements that you drag and drop onto your web page.">element tray</a> and dropping them onto a page. You access the editor from the Site Detail page in the Cloud Admin.</p>

<p>Learn about the Weebly Editor <a href="ds_gs_client_ui.html">here</a> .</p>

<h2 id="2-set-your-domain">2. Set Your Domain</h2>
<p>Log into the Cloud Admin to configure your domain. You can use either a subdomain of <code class="highlighter-rouge">weeblycloud.com</code> or you can use a custom domain. This domain is used to log into the Cloud Admin (<code class="highlighter-rouge">https://your-domain/admin</code>) and the User Portal (<code class="highlighter-rouge">https://your-domain/portal</code>).</p>

<p>Learn how to set it <a href="ds_gs_configure.html#set-your-domain">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="3-brand-the-cloud-admin-the-user-portal-and-the-weebly-editor">3. Brand the Cloud Admin, the User Portal, and the Weebly Editor.</h2>
<p>You can add your company name and logo to the Weebly Cloud tools and to the emails sent to clients when certain events happen, like giving a client access to a site. Follow these instructions to <a href="ds_gs_configure.html#brand-your-sites-and-the-cloud-admin">upload a logo and set your company name</a>. And you need to set the email used as the return address on emails sent by the Cloud Admin. Click <a href="ds_gs_configure.html#email-url">here</a> to set the email address.</p>

<h2 id="4-set-other-basic-settings">4. Set Other Basic Settings</h2>
<p>You need to configure other basic settings so that the Cloud Admin displays and behaves properly for you, including time zone, default language, and date and time formats. Check out how, <a href="ds_gs_configure.html#configure-basic-settings">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="5-create-a-plan">5. Create a Plan</h2>
<p>Every site you create must be associated with a plan. Plans determine the functionality available for a site. For example, the Weebly Starter Plan doesn’t allow site search, while the other plans do.</p>

<p>Instead of Weebly plans, your clients choose from plans that you create. You decide which Weebly plans you want to support, and then create your own plans to associate with them. Along with the features offered by each Weebly plan, you can set things like page limits and pricing structures. You must create at least one plan.</p>

<p>More <a href="ds_gs_plans.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="6-create-a-client">6. Create a Client</h2>
<p>Your clients are the people you design and create web sites for. You create and manage your clients from the Cloud Admin. You need a name and an email to set up a client. Learn how <a href="ds_gs_clients.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="7-determine-the-level-of-access-a-client-has">7. Determine the Level of Access a Client Has</h2>

<p>By default, clients don’t have access to any sites that you create for them. You need to set them up as a <a href="ds_gs_access_sites.html">site contributor</a> and set the level access you’d like them to have.</p>

<h2 id="8-create-and-publish-a-site">8. Create and Publish a Site</h2>
<p>Once you have a client, and you’ve created at least one plan, you can create a site. From the client’s detail page, it’s a simple as clicking <strong>Add Site</strong>. You’re taken to the Weebly Editor, where you can drag and drop elements to build the site. Once created, you edit, preview, and publish the site. Learn about creating, editing, and managing sites <a href="ds_gs_cr_sites.html">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="you-can-do-even-more">You Can Do Even More!</h2>
<p>Here’re some more checklist items you may want to do. They’re not crucial to get up and running with Weebly Cloud, but may need to be done at some point.</p>
<h3 id="set-up-a-contacts">Set Up a Contacts</h3>
<p>You can set up support, billing, and technical contacts for your company. The support contact info is displayed in the Weebly Editor, and might be helpful if your clients edit their own sites. The technical and billing contact info is shown to Weebly support so they know who to talk to about different issues. If you’re the main contact at your company, then you likely don’t need to create these two contacts. More <a href="ds_gs_configure.html#set-contact-info">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="create-team-members">Create Team Members</h3>
<p>If you have people working for you, you set them up as team members. You configure their access, so they might be able to do everything you can do, or you might limit access so that they can only access clients and their sites, or only access billing. More <a href="ds_gs_team_members.html">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="create-site-templates">Create Site Templates</h3>
<p>If you think most of your sites may start out with a similar look and feel, you can create a template that contains everything you’d like your sites to have. When you use a template, you get a big head start in creating a site, and you can fully edit the site, even the parts created with the template. Find out more about templates <a href="ds_gs_cr_sites.html#create-a-site-using-a-template">here</a>.</p>
