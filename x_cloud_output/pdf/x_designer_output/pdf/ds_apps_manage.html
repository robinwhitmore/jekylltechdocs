<h2 id="view-detailed-app-information">View Detailed App Information</h2>
<p>Clicking an app’s row on the main admin page takes you to its detail page where you can see the latest version of your app, the number of installs, and where you can <a href="ds_apps_element_upload.html">upload</a> and manage versions.</p>

<p>​​The top left card on this page displays your app’s information, including the information used for Weebly to programmatically recognize you: your client ID and your secret.</p>

<p>We create a development user and site for you. The development site is the Weebly-hosted site you can use to <a href="ds_apps_element_test.html">test</a> your app. Click <strong>Edit Site</strong> to open the Weebly editor where you can set up your development site. Click <strong>Show Details</strong> to view the Site Details page for your developer site. Here, you can view the development user and site information. This site always publishes to <code class="highlighter-rouge">[some_random_id].weebly.com</code>. You can install as many versions of the app to this site as you need, and they can be in any status (see next section).</p>

<p>The site is associated with the Developer Test plan, which is a Weebly plan used only for testing apps. It’s associated with the highest level Weebly plan, so all features are enabled. You can not delete or edit this plan.</p>

<p>Once your app is fully tested, you can <a href="ds_apps_element_release.html">associate</a> your app to a different Weebly plan. Any site associated with that plan will have the app automatically installed.</p>

<h2 id="set-app-status">Set App Status</h2>
<p>When you first upload your app, the version’s status is automatically set to <code class="highlighter-rouge">Draft</code>, and it can only be installed to your development site. You can have as many draft versions as you need. You can set an app version that’s in <code class="highlighter-rouge">draft</code> status to either <code class="highlighter-rouge">active</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">archived</code>.</p>

<div class="Notice type_info" role="alert">
	<b>Note:</b> App versions in <code class="highlighter-rouge">active</code> status are automatically moved to <code class="highlighter-rouge">archived</code> when a new version is made <code class="highlighter-rouge">active</code>. You don’t need to manually set the status. Versions in <code class="highlighter-rouge">archived</code> status can only remain as <code class="highlighter-rouge">archived.</code>
</div>

<p><strong>To set app status:</strong></p>

<p>From the App Detail page of the Cloud Admin, click the ellipses for the version whose status you want to change.</p>
<table width="100%">
    <tr>
     <th>If the current status is:</th>
     <th>You can change it to:</th>
     <th>Notes</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>Draft</code></td>
        <td><code class="highlighter-rouge">Active (Published)</code></td>
        <td>You can have only one version in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Active</code> status. The previously active version is set to <code>Archived</code>.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><code>Draft</code></td>
        <td><code>Archived</code></td>
        <td>If you set an <code class="highlighter-rouge">Active</code> version to <code>Draft</code> and then <code>Archived</code> and you don't set a different version to <code>Active</code>, then the app will be removed from the editor sidebar (if an element), but any elements already on a page will remain, and will use the last active version. All webhooks are immediately removed. Snippets are removed the next time the site is published.</td>
