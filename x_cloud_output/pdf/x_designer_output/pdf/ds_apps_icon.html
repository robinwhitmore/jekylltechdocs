<p>Your icon needs to follow these guidelines in order to display properly in the element tray.</p>

<h2 id="designing-your-icon">Designing Your Icon</h2>

<p>Your icon should convey the element’s purpose and functionality to the user. It may be that your company’s logo is appropriate. But usually you’ll need to design something that better visually describes what your element does. Take a look at the Weebly elements to get a good idea, or visit <a href="https://www.iconfinder.com/">Iconfinder</a> or <a href="https://thenounproject.com/">The Noun Project</a> for icons you can purchase.</p>

<h3 id="icon-size">Icon Size</h3>

<p>Icons appear within a canvas that is 70 pixels wide X 40 pixels high. The name of your element displays under the icon, so the size of your icon should not be so big that it will crowd the text, but not so small that it will be lost in the canvas.</p>

<h3 id="icon-color">Icon Color</h3>

<p>Icons should be provided in black or with some greyscale. We’ll recolor them to white.</p>

<p>Here’s a guide to follow:</p>

<h2 id="tools-for-creating-svg-files">Tools for Creating SVG Files</h2>

<p>There are plenty of great tools out there to create and edit <code class="highlighter-rouge">svg</code> files. <a href="http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/">Sketch</a> (Mac only) and <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html">Adobe Illustrator</a> are full graphic design toolsets for creating vector images, including <code class="highlighter-rouge">svg</code>. They’re not cheap, but they’ve got everything you’ll ever need to create full feature web graphics. <a href="https://github.com/SVG-Edit/svgedit">SVG-Edit</a> is a free online tool for working with <code class="highlighter-rouge">svg</code> files. <a href="https://inkscape.org/en/">Inkscape</a> is a free downloadable app that works with a number of file types, including <code class="highlighter-rouge">svg</code> (Mac users will also need to download XQuartz).</p>

<p>It may be that you already have a great graphic to use for your icon, but it’s a <code class="highlighter-rouge">png</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">jpg</code> instead of <code class="highlighter-rouge">svg</code>. Don’t worry - there are a number of apps you can use to convert it! <a href="http://picsvg.com/">PicSvg</a> is an online tool that converts your file to a monochrome <code class="highlighter-rouge">svg</code> file. Be sure to select <code class="highlighter-rouge">black</code> as the <code class="highlighter-rouge">svg</code> color. Both Sketch and Illustrator can also convert files to <code class="highlighter-rouge">svg</code>.</p>
