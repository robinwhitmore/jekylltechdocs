<p>​Test your app in the editor. If you created a tutorial, test that it displays properly and that the instructions and descriptions are correct. Publish your site and test the functionality on a published site. You may also want to test it on a mobile device.</p>

<p>As a developer, you can install multiple versions of your app onto your development site (and only your development site). When you reinstall your app, any previously installed versions will not be overwritten - you will have multiple versions installed to your test site. If you don’t wish to have multiple versions, be sure to archive your previous version before installing a newer version.</p>

<div class="Notice type_success" role="alert">
	<b>Tip:</b> This is not the case for your customers. When you release a new version of your app, any customer that has it installed will automatically receive the new version and will have the older version uninstalled for them.
</div>

<p>Repeat the install, editor development, and development site testing using the Weebly app from a mobile device, to be sure nothing breaks when used on smaller devices. Also make sure to test the scenario where a user may own multiple sites and wants to install your app onto more than one site.</p>

<p>To test on sites other than the development site:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Create a new app with the updates you’d like to test.</li>
  <li>Create a test <a href="ds_gs_plans.html">plan</a> .</li>
  <li>Set <a href="ds_apps_element_release.html">Auto-Install</a> to the test plan.</li>
  <li>Create some test <a href="ds_gs_cr_sites.html">sites</a>  and associate those sites with your test plan.</li>
  <li><a href="ds_apps_element_release.html">Release your app</a>  to that plan.
Your app should automatically be installed on your test sites.</li>
</ul>
