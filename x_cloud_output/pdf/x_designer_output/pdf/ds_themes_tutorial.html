    <p>In this tutorial, you’ll learn how to customize a Weebly theme. Instead of starting from scratch, we’ll use the Base theme, which provides all the Weebly-specific building blocks needed to work on the Weebly platform.</p>

<p><strong>You’ll learn how to:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Create the required directory structure</li>
  <li>Add a color palette so that users can choose their own primary and accent colors for the theme</li>
  <li>Edit a header template to alter the way the title and navigation display</li>
  <li>Edit the LESS file to alter styles and other display properties in the theme</li>
  <li>Create light and dark versions of the theme</li>
  <li>Edit a partial to alter how content displays on a page</li>
  <li>Create a theme option that allows the user to change the width of the heading</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Time to complete:</strong> About an hour</p>

<p><strong>User experience:</strong> Intermediate Web Design with knowledge of LESS/CSS</p>

<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Some knowledge of what makes up a Weebly Theme. Read <a href="ds_themes_anatomy.html">Anatomy of a Theme</a>
 before starting this tutorial.</li>
  <li>The Weebly Code Editor accessed from the Theme tab of the Weebly Editor.</li>
  <li>An app that can take a screenshot and then edit it to the required size.</li>
</ul>
