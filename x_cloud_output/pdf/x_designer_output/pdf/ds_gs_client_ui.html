<p>Here, they can view site stats as well as access the Weebly Editor. You configure the level of access clients have by setting <a href="ds_gs_access_sites.html">site contributor permissions</a>.</p>

<p>For example, you can completely <a href="ds_gs_access_sites.html">restrict a client’s access</a> so that they can’t access the editor at all. Or you might give limited access so that the client can view their site’s pages in the Weebly Editor, but they can’t add pages or publish. This screenshot shows the Weebly Editor with restricted permissions. There’s no Publish button and when the user clicks the Pages tab, instead of being shown the UI that lets them add pages, they’re shown a list of pages they can view.</p>

<p>You can also send your clients a preview of the published site. When you click the <strong>Preview</strong> button in the editor, the site displays in a preview window with a temporary URL that you can send to clients. The URL remains valid for 30 days.</p>
