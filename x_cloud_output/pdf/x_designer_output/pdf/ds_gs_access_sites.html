    <div class="summary">Once you create a site, you can add site contributors - users that have varying access to edit that site and some of the site's settings.</div>
    
    <h2 id="what-are-site-contributors">What are Site Contributors?</h2>

<p>Site contributors are users that have access to edit and manage a site, but are not owners of the site. For example, you might set up a client as a contributor to their site so that they can manage their store, but not edit or publish the site. Or you might provide access to certain pages to a team member at your company.</p>

<p>Site contributors can have one of two levels of access:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Admin:</strong> The contributor can do everything.</li>
  <li><strong>Limited:</strong> The contributor can only access the specific functionality (like editing specific pages, ability to publish the site, ability to change settings) that is assigned to them.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="create-site-contributors">Create Site Contributors</h2>
<p>You add site contributors in Cloud Admin, from the Site Detail page.</p>

<p><strong>To add a site contributor:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>In the Cloud Admin, from the client’s detail page, select a site.</li>
  <li>On the site’s detail page, click <strong>Add Contributor</strong>.</li>
  <li>
    <p>Choose to either create a new user or select an existing user.  If you want to add a client as a contributor, you need to create them as a new user. If you want to add a Team Member that has already been created in the Cloud Admin, then select <strong>Existing User</strong> and search for them by email.</p>

<p>​4. Click <strong>Set Permissions</strong> and either give them full permission to the site (by <strong>not</strong> selecting <strong>Limit Editor Permissions</strong>), or set explicit permissions by selecting that checkbox and then configuring access:</p>

<h2 id="manage-site-contributors">Manage Site Contributors</h2>
<p>Once created, you can change a contributor’s permissions or you can delete them as a contributor. Deleting a contributor only deletes that person’s access to the site.</p>

<p><strong>To manage a contributor:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>In the Cloud Admin, search for or browse to the site that they contribute to.</li>
  <li>To change permissions, in the Contributors area, click the <strong>Edit</strong> icon for the contributor and edit the permissions.</li>
  <li>To delete the contributor, click the <strong>Delete</strong> icon.</li>
</ol>
