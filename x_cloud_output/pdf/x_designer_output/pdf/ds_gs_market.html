<p>When a user publishes a site, the Weebly editor displays a publishing modal. It displays a link to the site just published, and often Weebly displays promotional material as well.</p>

	</figure>

<p>You can use this modal window to advertise your own services by setting the publish_upsell_url to a URL where you have content published. That content loads in an iframe (640px W by 200px H) when a site is published. Hereâ€™s an example of custom content in the modal (the yellow background is for demonstration purposes only).</p>

<h2 id="customize-the-publish-modal">Customize the Publish Modal</h2>
<p>Before you can configure Weebly Cloud to use custom content in the Publish modal, you need to create it on a site that can be accessed. You set the URL in the Cloud Admin.</p>

<p><strong>To set the URL in the Cloud Admin:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Create your custom content at a URL that can be accessed by the modal.</li>
  <li>
    <p>From the <strong>Settings</strong> page of the Cloud Admin, in the Configuration area, click the <strong>Edit</strong> icon for the <strong>Upsell URL</strong>.</p>
