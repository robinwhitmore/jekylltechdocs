<h2 id="packages">Packages</h2>
<p>The Packages tab is where you create and manage your plans. Weebly plans determine the functionality available to a site. For example, the Weebly Starter Plan doesn’t allow site search, while the other plans do. Video and audio players are only available on the Pro plan. You create your own plans and set pricing and other plan settings. Then you associate your plans with Weebly plans to determine the functionality available with each of your plans.</p>

<p>The main Package page displays each of your plans and is where you <a href="ds_gs_plans.html#create-plans-with-cloud-admin">create</a> a plan.</p>
