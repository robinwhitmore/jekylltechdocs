<p>By default, when a site is created for a client, they have no access to it, other than viewing the published site. You can give them specific access levels to a site by making them a <em>site contributor</em>. The level of access that you can configure is slightly different than what it used to be.</p>

<p>To set access for a client, from the site’s <a href="ds_mg_sites.html#site_detail">detail page</a>, in the Contributors section, click the <strong>Add Contributor</strong> link.</p>

<p>Make sure <strong>New User</strong> is selected at the top, and enter the client’s name, email address (other settings are optional) and click <strong>Set Permissions</strong>.</p>

<p>By default, the new contributor is given full access to the site. To limit access, select <strong>Limit Editor Permissions</strong> and configure the access level. More about setting access levels <a href="ds_gs_access_sites.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Once you set access, the client is listed as a contributor on the site’s detail page and you can change the access level at any time by clicking the <strong>Permissions</strong> link.</p>

<p>In Weebly Cloud, your staff are called <em>team members</em>. You create and manage team members from the <strong>TEAM</strong> tab of the Cloud Admin.</p>

<p>You can further restrict access to specific sites in the same way that you restrict access for your clients. But instead of creating a new site contributor, choose <strong>Existing User</strong> from the Add Contributor dialog and search for the team member by their email address.</p>
