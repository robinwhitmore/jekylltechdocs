    <div class="summary">You release your app by associating it with a plan. Every site on that plan will have the app installed.</div>
    
    <p>To release your app, you need to associate your app to a plan, and then publish the app, which changes its status to <code class="highlighter-rouge">Active</code>. Once the app is associated with a plan and published, sites will start to get the app installed automatically, as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Existing sites</strong>: Sites associated with the app’s plan have the app automatically installed as soon as the app is set to <code class="highlighter-rouge">Active</code>.</li>
  <li>​<strong>Newly created site</strong>: If the new site chooses the plan associated with the app, the app is pre-installed to the site.</li>
  <li><strong>Site is upgraded</strong>: If an existing site is upgraded to the app’s plan, the app is installed during the upgrade.</li>
  <li><strong>Site plan changes</strong>: If an existing site changes to a plan not associated with the app, the app is automatically uninstalled from the site. However, any instances of the app on the site will remain.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>To release your app</strong>:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Associate your app with a plan. On the <a href="ds_gs_admin.html#apps">app’s detail</a> page, click <strong>Auto-Install Settings</strong>. A dialog displays the plans that you’ve created.</li>
  <li>Select the plans that should include this app and click <strong>Save</strong>.
