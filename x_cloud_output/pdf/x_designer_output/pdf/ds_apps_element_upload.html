    <div class="summary">Once you create and package your app, you upload it so that you can test it and eventually release it to your customers.</div>
    
    <p>You upload your app using the Cloud Admin. Upload versions when you want to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Test your latest changes</li>
  <li>Release new versions to your customers
Be sure any upload adheres to the required  application <a href="ds_apps_element_folders.html">file structure</a> and <a href="ds_apps_manifest.html">manifest</a> structure.
After you’ve uploaded your application, you’ll want to install it on your test site to view and <a href="ds_apps_element_test.html">QA</a> it.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="package-your-app">Package Your App</h2>
<p>​Your app needs to be delivered as a zip file. Create a zip file FROM the root directory and not OF the root directory. In other words, open the root directory (where the <code class="highlighter-rouge">manifest.json</code> file should be), select all files and directories, then create a zip of those. If you create a zip of the root directory, your zip file will not be able to upload to Weebly. Also, make sure all directories and files have read and write permissions.</p>

<h2 id="upload-using-the-cloud-admin">Upload Using the Cloud Admin</h2>

<p>You upload new versions from the administration page for your application. From the <a data-container="body" data-toggle="popover" data-content="The site used to manage your users, site owners and their accounts, as well as apps and billing. You access Cloud Admin at weeblycloud.com/admin">Cloud Admin</a> APPS page, click the application name to open up its details page. Click <strong>Upload New Version</strong>, navigate to the ZIP file that contains your latest application bundle, and click <strong>Upload new ZIP</strong>.</p>
