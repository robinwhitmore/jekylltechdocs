</div>

<div class="post-content">

    
    <div class="summary">If you will edit your theme using the Weebly Code Editor, the directories and files are created for you remotely. If you want to use another editor, follow these guidelines to set up your development directory.</div>
    
    <p>Instead of creating directories and files, <a href="ds_themes_sample.html">download the Base theme</a>  and unzip it to create the proper directory structure. Or, <a href="ds_themes_import_export.html">export</a> any other theme to start.</p>

<p>When you unzip the archive, you’ll see that the theme’s root directory contains the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">manifest.json</code> file.  This file provides <a href="ds_themes_manifest.html">configuration</a> for the theme, including optional functionality.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">main_style.css</code> file. This is the stylesheet for the theme, when using CSS.</li>
</ul>

<div class="Notice type_info" role="alert">
	<b>Note:</b> If your theme uses LESS rather than CSS, the LESS stylesheet(s) is in the /styles directory. Your theme should use either CSS or LESS, not both. If both exist, the CSS file will be ignored.
</div>

<ul>
  <li>HTML template files for each of the different header types</li>
  <li>JavaScript files (these may be in the assets directory).</li>
  <li>assets (optional directory): Contains images, fonts, and Javascript files. If there are only a few of these files, they may be at the root instead.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">partials</code> (directory): Contains custom partials used on the pages.</li>
</ul>

<div class="Notice type_info" role="alert">
	<b>Note:</b> If you do not edit the default partials using the Weebly Code Editor, then they are not included in the Zip file. Only customized partials are included. So if you want to edit a partial, make a small edit to it in the editor and then export it.
</div>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">images</code> (optional directory): You can either place your images in this directory, or keep them at the root. Just be sure to refer to them correctly.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">styles</code> (if using LESS): Contains the stylesheet(s) for the theme. If you use color variations, your theme will have more than one stylesheet.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">screenshot.jpg</code> file (once you <a href="ds_themes_screenshot.html">create</a> it): This file is used to display your theme in the Theme chooser, shown when a user creates a site or changes the theme and in the Cloud Admin.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are working in an external editor, once you make your changes and need to test in Weebly, zip up the contents of the directory (and not the directory itself) and <a href="ds_themes_import_export.html">import</a> it into Weebly.</p>

<div class="Notice type_info" role="alert">
	<b>Note:</b> When zipping your theme, be sure to zip the contents of your root folder, and not the root folder itself.  Your theme will be invalid if it includes the root folder!
</div>

<p>The Code Editor displays a logical structure of the directories, which is different from the actual physical structure. Header type templates are shown in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Header Type</code> directory. Partials are shown in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Partials</code> directory. Every other file type is shown in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Assets</code> directory. If you created any sub-directories, those also display in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Assets</code> directory.</p>

<p>This screenshot shows how the Base theme’s files appear in the editor. Note that this theme contains an images sub-directory displayed in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Assets</code> directory.</p>

<div class="Notice type_info" role="alert">
	<b>Note:</b> Always use the physical path when you refer to assets in your code.  For example, to refer to images in the Base theme, you would use <code class="highlighter-rouge">/images/dark-background.jpg</code> and not <code class="highlighter-rouge">/assets/images/dark-background.jpg</code>.
