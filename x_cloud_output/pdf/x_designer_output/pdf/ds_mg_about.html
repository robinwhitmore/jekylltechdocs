    <p>Welcome to the new Weebly Cloud for Designers!</p>

<p>These topics will help you understand how to do everything you used to do in the Designer Platform portal in Weebly Cloud.</p>

<p>You’ll now do most of your work from the Cloud Admin, accessed from <code class="highlighter-rouge">your_weebly_domain/admin</code>.</p>

<div class="Notice type_info" role="alert">
	<b>Note:</b> You set your Weebly domain when you configure your account. Ask your account rep for more info.

<p>You use this admin tool to manage your clients and their sites, as well as your business.</p>
