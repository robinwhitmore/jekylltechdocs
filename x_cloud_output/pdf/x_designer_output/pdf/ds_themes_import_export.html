<p>Weebly themes must be provided as a ZIP file (directory structure <a href="ds_themes_directory.html">here</a>). Styles must live in <code class="highlighter-rouge">main_style.css</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">main.less</code> (if using LESS). Make sure you’ve included all images and other assets.</p>

<div class="Notice type_info" role="alert">
	<b>Note:</b> The zip file must contain the contents of the theme’s root directory, and NOT the root directory folder itself. If you create your zip from a source control app like GitHub, the zip may include that root folder. You’ll need to extract and then rezip only the contents (and not the root directory) before importing into Weebly.

<div class="Notice type_info" role="alert">
	<b>Note:</b> All themes use the same default partials, which are available only in the Editor. Only customized partials are downloaded when you export a theme. So if you want to work in an external tool and want to change a partial, make a small change first in the Weebly editor, and then export the theme.
