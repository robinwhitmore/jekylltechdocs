    <div class="summary">You use the Settings tab of the Weebly Cloud Admin portal to configure your cloud account. You can add your logo and other company links and contact info, configure locale settings like time and date, set up messages for our support team, set up your domain and URLs, contacts, and access your API keys.</div>
    
    <h2 id="brand-your-sites-and-the-cloud-admin">Brand Your Sites and the Cloud Admin</h2>
<p>You can brand Weebly Cloud by adding your company’s name and uploading your company’s logo and a fav icon. Once configured, your company’s name displays in a number of places, such as the footer of published sites, in the Site Editor, and in invitaiton emails.</p>

<p>For example, here’s the footer of a published site showing the company name Nash Hosting.</p>

<p>And here’s an email sent inviting a new user.</p>

<h2 id="set-your-domain">Set Your Domain</h2>

<p>You can set a domain that is used to access both the Cloud Admin (<code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;your_domain&gt;/admin</code>) and the User portal (<code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;your_domain&gt;/portal</code>), and that displays in the user’s address bar when using the Site Editor. You can choose to use a subdomain of <code class="highlighter-rouge">weeblycloud.com</code> or you can use a custom domain.</p>
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> <b>Note:</b> If you don’t configure a domain, you will not be able to generate and send emails from the Cloud Admin and you will not have access to the User portal.</div>

<p>​To set a subdomain, in the Domain area, click the <strong>Edit</strong> icon, click <strong>Subdomain</strong>, enter the subdomain to be used, and click <strong>Save</strong>. If the subdomain is available, a green checkmark displays. The subdomain will be applied to both the Cloud Admin and the User Login portals.</p>
