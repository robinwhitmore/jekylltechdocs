<h2 id="set-your-domain">Set Your Domain</h2>

<p>You can set a domain to access both the Cloud Admin (<code class="highlighter-rouge">http://your_domain/admin</code>) and the User portal (<code class="highlighter-rouge">http://your_domain/portal</code>), and that displays in the user’s address bar when using the Site Editor. You can choose to use a subdomain of <code class="highlighter-rouge">weeblycloud.com</code> or you can use a custom domain.</p>

<div class="Notice type_info" role="alert">
	<b>Note:</b> If you don’t configure a domain, you will not be able to generate and send emails from the Cloud Admin and you will not have access to the User portal.
</div>

<p><strong>To set a subdomain:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>From the Cloud Admin, click the <strong>Settings</strong> tab.</li>
  <li>In the <strong>Domain</strong> area, click the <strong>Edit</strong> icon.</li>
  <li>
    <p>To use a subdomain of <code class="highlighter-rouge">weeblycloud.com</code>, click <strong>Subdomain</strong>, enter the subdomain to be used, and click <strong>Save</strong>. If the subdomain is available, a green checkmark displays. The subdomain will be applied to both the Cloud Admin and the User portal, and to the Site Editor URL.</p>

<p>You now need to add a <code class="highlighter-rouge">CNAME</code> that points <code class="highlighter-rouge">weeblycloud.com</code> to the DNS for your domain. Follow the instructions in the resulting dialog.</p>

<h2 id="footer-link-and-email-url">Footer Link and Email URL</h2>

<p>Your company name displays as a link in the footer of all your customer sites (the color and styling of the link is determined by the theme in use). You must add a URL to a specific page about your company  for that link. This URL is also used as the return email address on emails automatically sent by the Cloud Admin, such as the team member and customer invitations. This URL is required. In this example, the company’s name is Nash Hosting.</p>

<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> <b>Note:</b> While the emails will appear to be from this destination, they are actually sent from a Weebly IP address.

<p><strong>To set the URL:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>From the Cloud Admin, click the <strong>Settings</strong> tab.</li>

<h2 id="configure-basic-settings">Configure Basic Settings</h2>

<p>You can configure locale settings for your sites, such language, time zone, and you can also configure upgrade and upsell URLs.</p>

<p><strong>To configure basic settings:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>From the Cloud Admin, click the <strong>Settings</strong> tab.</li>
  <li>
    <p>In the <strong>Configuration</strong> area, click the <strong>Edit</strong> icon and enter the appropriate info for the following:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Upgrade URL</strong>: When a customer encounters a feature in the Weebly Editor that is part of a plan they do not currently have, they will be prompted to upgrade. This triggers a popup window that loads a URL showing the plans they can upgrade to. Enter that URL here. More about how upgrades work can be found <a href="cl_gs_upgrades.html">here</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Publish Upsell URL</strong>: When a customer publishes a site, the Weebly editor displays a publishing modal with a link to the site just published, and often Weebly promotional material as well. You can set a link to a promotion for your company by entering a URL here. The resulting content loads in an iframe (640px W by 200px H) when the site is published. More info <a href="cl_gs_upgrades.html">here</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Default User Language</strong>: Select the default language displayed to your team and customers. They can always change this by selecting a different language from the Settings tab of the editor, or if enabled, the language picker in the User Portal.</li>
  <li><strong>Default Time Zone</strong>: Select the default time zone used by the Site Editor.</li>
  <li><strong>Default Date Format</strong>: Select how you want dates displayed by default. You can choose either <code class="highlighter-rouge">MM/DD/YYYY</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">DD/MM/YYYY</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>Default Time Format</strong>: Select how time should display by default - either 12 or 24 hour.</li>
</ul>

<div class="Notice type_info" role="alert">
	<b>Note:</b> You don’t need to worry about the Upgrade URL or hash. These are used by Weebly enterprise accounts to automatically upgrade their customers when they try to access functionality not covered by their current plan. As a Designer, you will likely upgrade your clients’ plans manually. If you’re interested in automatic upgrading, contact your account representative.
</div>

<h2 id="view-your-upgrade-hash">View Your Upgrade Hash</h2>

<p>As part of the upgrade URL, Weebly passes in a hash that includes the user ID, the site ID, and a reseller-specific hash. You need to decode this hash to verify that the URL was accessed from the Weebly editor. You can see that hash from the <strong>Upgrade Settings</strong> area of the Cloud Admin. More about the hash and how to handle the upgrade process <a href="cl_gs_upgrades.html">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>To view the hash:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>From the Cloud Admin, click the <strong>Settings</strong> tab.</li>
  <li>Click the <strong>Show link</strong> in <strong>Upgrade Settings</strong> area. You can also edit the hash by clicking the <strong>Edit</strong> icon.</li>
</ol>

<div class="Notice type_info" role="alert">
	<b>Note:</b> If you edit the upgrade hash and you use the WHMCS plug-in, then you must update that configuration as well.
