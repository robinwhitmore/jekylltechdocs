## Brand Your Sites and the Cloud Admin
You can brand Weebly Cloud by adding your company's name and uploading your company's logo and a fav icon. Once configured, your company's name displays in a number of places, such as the footer of published sites, in the Site Editor, and in invitaiton emails.

For example, here's the footer of a published site showing the company name Nash Hosting.
{% include image.html file="cl_settings_footerName.png" caption="Footer of a published site on Nash Hosting" %}

And here's an email sent inviting a new user.
{% include image.html file="cl_settings_mail.png" caption="Footer of a published site on Nash Hosting" %}
