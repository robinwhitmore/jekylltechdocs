<!--todo: verify tabs-->
<!--todo: get screenshots-->
## Clients
The Clients tab is where you [create](ds_gs_clients) new clients, as well as browse through or search for existing clients.

When you click on a client name, you're taken to the client's detail page. Here, you can [manage](ds_gs_clients.html#manage-clients) different aspects of the client, as well as create sites for them.

## Team
If your company has more than one person who will use the Cloud Admin, you create [create](ds_gs_team_members.html#create-a-team-member) those users as Team Members.

When you click on a member name, you navigate to their detail page where you [assign a role](ds_gs_team_members.html#team-member-roles) that determines the level of access they have in the Cloud Admin.

## Packages
The Packages tab is where you create and manage your plans. Weebly plans determine the functionality available to a site. For example, the Weebly Starter Plan doesn't allow site search, while the other plans do. Video and audio players are only available on the Pro plan{%if site.project=="cloud"%} and above{% endif %}. You create your own plans and set pricing and other plan settings. Then you associate your plans with Weebly plans to determine the functionality available with each of your plans.

The main Package page displays each of your plans and is where you [create](ds_gs_plans.html#create-plans-with-cloud-admin) a plan.

## Apps
You can develop custom apps that you install to your client's sites. You use the Apps tab to [create](ds_apps_gs.html), manage, and [release](ds_apps_element_release.html) those apps.

<span style="color: red">[[screenshot of app detail page]]</span>

## Themes
<!--todo: add links to themes-->
Weebly themes provide a general structure and design palette for any website built using the Weebly editor. While Weebly provides a number of themes, you may want to create your own. You use the Themes tab to upload your custom themes so that they are available to your sites.

<span style="color: red">[[screenshot of theme upload page]]</span>

## Billing
The Billing tab allows you to [view and pay](ds_gs_invoice.html) your Weebly invoices.

When you click an invoice, you can view its details.
