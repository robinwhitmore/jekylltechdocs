Welcome to the new Weebly Cloud for Designers!

These topics will help you understand how to do everything you used to do in the Designer Platform portal in Weebly Cloud.

You'll now do most of your work from the Cloud Admin, accessed from `your_weebly_domain/admin`.
  
  {% include note.html content="You set your Weebly domain when you configure your account. Ask your account rep for more info." %}

  You use this admin tool to manage your clients and their sites, as well as your business.

  You'll continue to use the Weebly editor to edit sites and view site info like blog post comments and form entries.
  {% include image.html file="cl_editor2.png" caption="Weebly Editor" %}

  Each topic shows the screens you used in the old Designer Platform to complete a task and maps them to the screens in the Cloud Admin or Weebly editor.
