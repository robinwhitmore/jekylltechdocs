summary: Plans determine what functionality a site has. If you try to access functionality not supported by the plan, a popup displays information about upgrading. If you expect your clients to be using the Weebly Editor, you need to provide the content for this popup and you need to handle the upgrade process. If clients won't be using the editor, you'll be shown the standard Weebly dialog.

<!--todo: not sure of the use case here. do designers need to implement upgrades? what happens if they don't? -->
