## Add a Site
{% include image.html file="old_addSite.png" caption="Add a site in the Designer Platform" %}

In the Cloud Admin, you add a site from the client's detail page.
{% include image.html file="new_siteAdd.png" caption="Add a site from the client's detail page." %}
{% include image.html file="new_siteAdd2.png" caption="Add a site from the client's detail page." %}

You can create the site from scratch, or you can copy an existing site or use a template.

When you create a site, you're taken to the site's detail page where you can further manage it.

## Edit a Site
{% include image.html file="old_editSite.png" caption="Edit a site in the Designer Platform" %}

You can edit a site from the site's detail page in Cloud Admin.
{% include image.html file="new_siteEdit.png" caption="Edit a site in the Cloud Admin" %}

As previously, clicking Edit Site takes  you to the Weebly editor.

## Preview a Site

You now preview a site directly from the Editor.
{% include image.html file="new_sitePreview.png" caption="Preview a site from the Weebly Editor" %}

You can also preview a site from the site's detail page.
{% include image.html file="new_sitePreview2.png" caption="Preview a site from the details page" %}

## Delete a Site
{% include image.html file="old_siteDelete.png" caption="Delete a site in Designer Platform" %}

You delete a site from the site's detail page.
{% include image.html file="new_siteDelete.png" caption="Delete a site" %}

You can view all deleted sites from the client's detail page.
{% include image.html file="new_siteDeletedList.png" caption="List deleted sites" %}

<h2>{% include label.html content="new!" %}Restore a Site</h2>
You can restore a deleted site from the Deleted Sites dialog accessed from the [Deleted Sites](#delete-a-site) link on the client detail page.
{% include image.html file="new_restoreSite.png" caption="Restore sites" %}

<h2>{% include label.html content="new!" %}Restore Text Elements to a Page on a Site</h2>
You can restore deleted text elements back to a page from the site's detail page in the Cloud Admin. In the Pages section, click the gear icon for the page with the deleted elements and choose **Restore Elements**.
{% include image.html file="new_elementRestore.png" caption="Restore elements to a page" %}

Select the text element to restore and click **Restore Elements**.
{% include image.html file="new_restoreElement2.png" caption="Restore elements to a page" %}

## View Site Statistics
{% include image.html file="old_siteStats.png" caption="View statistics in the Designer Portal" %}

You now access site stats from the User Portal. You access that portal from `your_domain.com/portal`. When your clients log in, they see a list of any sites they have access to.

  {% include image.html file="new_userPortal.png" caption="User Portal" %}

  Click the **Stats** link to view stats for the site.
{% include image.html file="new_siteStats.png" caption="Site statistics in User Portal" %}

  Now you access blog comments directly from the blog's page in the editor.
{% include image.html file="new_blogComments.png" caption="Blog comments in the Weebly Editor" %}

  And you manage the comments from the resulting dialog.
{% include image.html file="new_blogCommentsMge.png" caption ="Blog comments dialog" %}
  
## View Form Entries
  {% include image.html file="old_forms.png" caption="Form entries in Designer Portal" %}

  Like blog comments, you access form entries directly from the editor by clicking on the form.
{% include image.html file="new_form.png" caption="Form entries in the editor" %}

  And you manage the entries from the resulting dialog.
{% include image.html file="new_formEntry.png" caption="Form entries" %}

<h2>{% include label.html content="new!" %}Change a Site's Plan</h2>
  You can change the plan a site is on from the bottom of the site's detail page.
{% include image.html file="new_sitePlan.png" caption="Site plans can be changed" %}
