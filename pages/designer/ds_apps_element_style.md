summary: Stylesheets are the paint and polish on top of your element. They provide style instructions, and are a powerful way to make your element appear more professional. Keep in mind though that the sites using your element are styled using themes. You want your element to also be styled by themes so that it appears seamless. The styling you add for your element should be minimal - only style HTML components that you want to appear the same in every site, no matter the theme being used.
