summary: When you create a Weebly theme, your design needs to support the functionality found on the pages in the different areas of a Weebly site, as well support the elements often used on a site. For example, blog pages expect certain content and elements, while pages that display products expect something different. Because users can easily switch between themes, you need to make sure that you follow these guidelines and requirements to ensure switching between themes is a smooth transition.
