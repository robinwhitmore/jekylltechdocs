summary: Your stylesheets provide the look and feel of the theme, and as such, is what gives your theme its soul. Weebly themes support both CSS and LESS, which is a pre-processor for CSS that provides additional functionality, such as variables, mixins, and nesting. You can use either CSS or LESS, but not a mix.
