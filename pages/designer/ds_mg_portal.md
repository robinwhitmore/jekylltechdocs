You set up your company's contact info from the **SETTINGS** tab of the Cloud Admin. You can set up the following contact types:

* Billing
* Support
* Technical

More info about the different contact types and how they are used can be found [here](ds_gs_configure.html#set-contact-info). Click the **Add Contact** link to add a new contact.

Select a contact type and enter a name, email, and optional phone number and website.

## Brand the Cloud Admin and Customer Portal
{% include image.html file="old_portalBrand.png" caption="Add branding in Designer Platform" %}

You can brand the Cloud Admin, the User portal, the Weebly editor, and emails by uploading a logo, a favicon, and setting a footer message.

Click the **SETTINGS** tab of the Cloud Admin and upload icons from the **Customize** section. 
{% include image.html file="new_settingsIcon.png" caption="Brand settings in the Cloud Admin" %}

More info about where the icons and footer message display can be found [here](ds_gs_configure.html#brand-your-sites-and-the-cloud-admin).

## Set URLs
{% include image.html file="old_urls.png" caption="Setting URLs in Designer Platform" %}

You set your URLs from the **SETTINGS** tab of the Cloud Admin. In the Domain section, click the **Edit** icon to set your domain, either as a subdomain of `weeblycloud.com` or as a custom domain. 

{% include image.html file="new_settingsDomain.png" caption="Set domains in the Cloud Admin" %}

Once that is set, the URL for the Cloud Admin automatically becomes `your_domain/admin` and the URL for the User portal becomes `your_domain/portal`.
