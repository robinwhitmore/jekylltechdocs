summary: When you create a Weebly theme, your design needs to support the functionality found on the pages in the different areas of a Weebly site, as well support the elements often used on a site. For example, blog pages require certain functionality and elements, while pages that display products require something different. Gallery elements that display multiple images need to have specific styling available. Because users can easily switch between themes, you need to make sure that you follow these guidelines and requirements to ensure switching between themes is a smooth transition.

## Page Guidelines
Weebly sites have different areas, and each area uses a special type of page. These areas include:
* **General**: Pages like Home, About, and Contact fall into this area
* **Blog**: Blog pages have functionality like listing blog posts and comments
* **Search**: Search results need to display and potentially be filtered.

Blog and search pages provide users extra functionality. Your theme needs to adhere to certain requirements to ensure that functionality is available. Find those requirements here.

## Layout Types
Weebly themes support different header layouts, allowing users to pick from a number of different looks for the different pages in their site. You'll need to provide HTML templates and styling for at least these:
* **Tall Header**: Uses a background image
* **No Header**: Header/banner is removed
* **Landing Page**: Title, sub-title/text and button (image)

You'll likely want to create templates for these layouts as well. The more flexibility that you provide, the more popular your theme is likely to become.
* **Title Page**: Title, sub-title/text (image)
* **Splash Page**: Full screen image content wrapper

Within the heading area, if you want your theme to allow social icons, a phone number, or a search box, you may want to add these as options that the user can turn on and off. Your design should accommodate for this ability. Also within the heading, you can add an area that allows the user to change the background or layout without having to touch the code.

Within the body, you can add a section and the user can then change the background and layout and move or copy the section without the need for code. Both the header area and sections provide flexible, efficient designs that are easily modified to suit each user's needs.
