## What are Weebly Apps
Consider an app to be a bundle that contains one or more of the following types of functionality: backend services, snippets, elements, dashboard cards, and themes. Your app can include one or more of these (more on what these are, below). Apps are installable ZIP files accessed from the Weebly App Center, and contain the following:
* Code that needs to reside on your customer's website, such as JavaScript, CSS, and HTML
* A JSON manifest file that defines configuration metadata for your app
* Assets used to display and market your app in the App Center.

All Weebly apps use a manifest to configure certain aspects of the app, such as name, version, and URLs used for installation and management. Weebly apps that require access to user and site information or otherwise need to access the Weebly API, must implement the OAuth process. This flow allows your customer to grant the app permission to be installed access specific data.

While each type of functionality has its own development process, to start creating your app, read the App Policy Requirements and Development topics. These are the requirements and the development steps that all app types must follow. Then use the topics specific to the type you're creating to continue your development.
