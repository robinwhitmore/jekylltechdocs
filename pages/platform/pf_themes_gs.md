summary: Themes provide the general look and feel used throughout a website. While Weebly provides a number of great themes, you may find you want to change a few things in a theme. Or maybe you want to change everything! You can do those and everything in between. And once you're done, you can use it on your site or share with your client or friends. To get started, create a web site that you can use to test your theme. Then download our Base theme as a starting point, and start building from there! Or find a theme you mostly like and then change the things you don't. These docs will provide you with all you need to bring your design to the web.

## Working in the Weebly Theme Editor
When you're creating your theme, you can work completely in the Weebly UI, or you can develp in external apps. You begin building your theme from the Theme tab in the Editor. On this tab, you can make simple changes to an existing theme - like change fonts or the color palette.
