## Offering the Weebly App Center

Weebly’s App Center is a growing marketplace where site owners find new apps, plugins and services to enhance your site.
There are three types of Apps offered in the center:

* **App Elements:** Elements added to the editor sidebar that can be dragged into a site, just like native Weebly elements.
* **Snippets:** JavaScript that is added to and runs on every published page. For example,  a live chat bubble in the footer is actually a snippet. The site owner only needs to install the app, nothing needs to be dragged onto the page.
* **Backend/API:** These apps leverage our APIs to sync store orders, products, blog posts, etc. They may not have any UI in the Editor at all.
​

Site owners can browse through collections, categories and sub-categories, can filter based on ratings, popularity, freshness, or free apps, and can search using keywords.

Each app has a details page that describes the app, explains the pricing, displays ratings, and provides an install button. Apps can also have an optional live demo site where you can view the app in action.

Site owners access these apps from the Editor, and can also visit the App Center from here.

They manage and uninstall apps from the Manage Apps page, also accessed from the Editor, or from the Settings page.

To provide access to the Weebly App Center, get in touch with your Account Manager or Business Development contact who will turn this on for your account. Once the App Center is activated, you need to explicitly add App Center access to your site plan(s)<span style="color: red">[[URL:create-plans]]</span>. The links to the App Center (including those in the header and those in the Editor) display only for sites that have purchased plans that include the App Center.

If you allow site contributors<span style="color: red">[[URL:create-and-manage-site-contributors]]</span>, those with Admin privileges will be able to access the App Center. All other contributors need to be granted explicit access.

If you want to be able to install apps for your customers, but not allow them access to the App Center, you or a team member can temporarily set the site's plan to one that allows App Center access, log into the site and install the app(s), and then change the plan to one that cannot access the App Center. The customer will be able to use and manage the app, but will not be able to visit the App Center.

## Creating Your Own Custom Apps

Along with apps from the App Center, you can develop custom apps<span style="color:red">[[URL:get-started-with-developing-apps]]</span> that are installed into sites, based on the plan they are associated with. For example, you might create a custom commenting app and automatically install it to all customers on the Pro plan. And just like the apps in the App Center, your custom apps can be as simple as a code snippet installed directly into your customers' sites or they can be elements that site owners can use on their site's pages.

You work with the Weebly Cloud API to create your app and then configure its availability in the Cloud Admin. You'll also be given access to your own development site (hosted on Weebly) that you can use to test your app. This site has special developer features, such as being able to install more than one version of your app. Team members with the role<span style="color:red">[[URL:create-cloud-admin-users]]</span> of Admin or Technical are able to create and manage an app and use the development site.
